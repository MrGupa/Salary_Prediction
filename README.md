# Salary Prediction Notebook

This project contains a Jupyter notebook for predicting salaries based on various factors such as country, education level, employment status, and years of professional experience. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation.

## Overview

The `Salary_Prediction.ipynb` notebook performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading**: Loads the dataset containing survey results related to salaries.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans the data by handling missing values and filtering relevant entries.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transforms categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for machine learning models.
4. **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model to predict salaries based on the processed features.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
